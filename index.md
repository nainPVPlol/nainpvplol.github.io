## 📋 How Yomix Works
Yomix helps users blend their Bitcoin transactions with those of others. This mixing process enhances the privacy of your transactions, making it difficult for anyone to trace them back to you. In 2026, this service remains relevant as more people focus on protecting their financial privacy.

## 🌐 Privacy Mechanisms
Yomix uses several privacy tools to secure your transactions:

1. **CoinJoin**: This method mixes coins from multiple users, making it hard to identify the source of funds.
2. **Zero-knowledge proofs**: These ensure that transactions can be validated without revealing the user's wallet address.
3. **Transaction obfuscation**: By breaking transactions into smaller parts, Yomix obscures the transaction link.

These mechanisms ensure a high level of anonymity for all users.

To run Yomix, ensure your device meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS Mojave or later, or a supported Linux distribution.
